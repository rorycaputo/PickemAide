spread_odds_converter.py

Converts American odds quoted at one point spread into the equivalent odds
at a different point spread. Half-point moves near football's "key numbers"
(3, 7, 6, 10, 14...) are priced more expensively than half-point moves
elsewhere, because those margins concentrate real probability mass (field
goals, touchdowns, and combinations of them).

SOURCE OF THE WEIGHTS
----------------------
MOV_FREQUENCY_PCT below is not a guess or a rule of thumb -- it's computed
directly from actual NFL game data (nflverse's games.csv, 2015-2025 regular
season + playoffs, n=3,028 games; https://github.com/nflverse/nfldata).
Each value is simply: what % of games in that sample ended with that exact
margin of victory. That percentage IS the probability mass sitting on that
number, so it's used directly as a probability shift -- no fudge-factor
multiplier needed.

We deliberately used only 2015-2025, not the full history back to 1999/1989.
The NFL moved extra-point attempts from the 2-yard line to the 15-yard line
starting in 2015, which meaningfully changed the scoring distribution --
missed PATs and more frequent 2-point attempts shifted real weight onto
6-point margins in particular (6-point games went from ~5.5% pre-2015 to
~8% post-2015 in various published breakdowns). Using pre-2015 data would
understate 6 and overstate 10 relative to today's game.

Caveat: sample sizes shrink fast for less common margins. 3 and 7 (n well
into the hundreds) are trustworthy; margins past ~17 are thin and noisy --
treat those as rough.

    Convert odds quoted at from_spread into equivalent odds at to_spread,
    for the SAME side of the bet (e.g. -7/-110 -> -6.5/??? for the favorite).

    Convention: spreads are signed as normally quoted for the side you're
    pricing (favorite negative, dog positive). Moving the spread value UP
    makes that side easier to cover (better for the bettor); moving it DOWN
    makes it harder (worse).

    THE MATH, why a push isn't a simple probability add-on:
    A push pulls probability mass entirely out of the win/loss pool rather
    than shifting the odds by that amount directly. Walking through a
    single 0.5-point step across a key number margin M (p = P(margin==M)):

      Direction improves for the bettor, ARRIVING at M (e.g. -3.5 -> -3,
      or +2.5 -> +3): p_new = p_old / (1 - p)
      Direction improves, LEAVING M (e.g. -3 -> -2.5, or +3 -> +3.5):
      p_new = p_old * (1 - p) + p

    Every 0.5-point step touches exactly one integer (either the step's
    start or its end, never both, never neither, since the .0/.5 grid
    alternates) -- so exactly one of "arriving" or "leaving" always
    applies, with p = 0 for non-key integers, which correctly reduces
    each formula to a no-op on top of the small baseline step cost.
